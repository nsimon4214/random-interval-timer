# random-interval-timer

This small program was designed to be used as a helpful way to mix up at-home workouts.
The user sets the minimum and maxiumum time for the interval, and the program will then
countdown to random times within the specified interval. The idea was to randomize rest
and exercise intervals to break up boring workouts. For example, the user can set the
minimum time interval to 60 seconds, and the max to 120 seconds, then run the program
and do pushups for 98 seconds, rest for 81 seconds, situps for 67 seconds, and so on.
